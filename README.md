# Financial Number Converter

## Overview
Developed by Derek Hoffman, this Angular application allows users to convert financial shorthand notations (like "250k", "10m", or ".5b") into their full numeric forms ("250,000", "10,000,000", "500,000,000").

## How to Use
1. **Input**: Enter a financial shorthand notation.
2. **Convert**: Submit to see the full numeric representation.
3. **View Result**: The expanded form is displayed on a new page.

## Development

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running Unit Tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.


## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
